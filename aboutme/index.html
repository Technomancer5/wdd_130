    <p>       I am currently working on a degree in software engineering with a focus in cybersecurity.  I am married and currently work at Walmart in the 
        Entertainment department until I can get a entry level job in cybersecurity or IT.  I am currently in the process of building my own website and server 
    where I plan to store informational articles and I want this class to enhance my knowledge to better achieve this goal. </p>
