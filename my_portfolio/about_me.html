            <h4>
                Welcome to my chronicling of my Cybersecurity journey, I hope 
                you can see both the path I have taken to get where I am, as 
                well as my future aspirations. From a young age I have been 
                presented with problems that I needed to solve, I can remember 
                wanting to play Nintendo 64 at my cousins house but his mother 
                did not know how to set it up and he was not there. I knew that 
                if I wanted to play game then I would need to figure out the 
                mysterious yellow, white and red cables and figure out how to 
                plug them into the tv in the white colored plugs that looked 
                the same shape but were not color-coded like on the game system. 
                This has since evolved into wanting to configure my own Raid 
                storage for my computer with NVMe drives and things like 
                accessing my Apple computer with my Linux system through command 
                line to use Emacs. Whether I have a need to do something out of 
                my league to solve an issue I am having, like wanting to have my 
                own website server or because I want to upgrade my computer to 
                play the latest game, I am passionate about accomplishing my 
                goals.

                One of my favorite things about technology is the never-ending 
                evolution and requirement to learn about the latest products and 
                ideas. There is an abundance of different things to learn in each 
                of the many niches that technology has to offer. This makes it 
                easy to feed my addiction of research and my drive to learn 
                everything I can. It has become harder to realize I have to be 
                more selective of the tasks I choose and things I educate myself 
                on simply because of the sheer growth of the world. This has 
                given me the insight to see which things correlate the most and 
                focus on those. Seeing how some things fade away as well as how 
                they emerge enhances these insights even farther.
        
                My father owns a construction company and I have worked there 
                from a young age seeing how things are put together and how to 
                tackle large projects. Working in the mountains comes with many 
                challenges, like having minimal space to work or fit equipment 
                and steep inclines and hard to reach areas. I have learned to 
                develop problems solving skills and spatial awareness fitting 
                large equipment like a backhoe into a very small area and 
                having to work with large amounts of dirt in very small spaces. 
                Keeping equipment maintained and seeing how managing materials 
                and time wisely affects the profits of a company has given me 
                respect for how a business can profit.
        
                Since my time in Anderson Construction, I have moved away from 
                California to buy a house and raise a family while pursuing the 
                career of my choosing, Cybersecurity. I got a job at my local 
                Walmart working in the entertainment department while I finish 
                getting my Associate degree in software engineering. I have since 
                gained experience in customer service and satisfaction, as well 
                as seeing the types of issues people have and learning the best 
                ways to help them. My education has helped me in solving the 
                unique problems they come to me with and giving them the most 
                efficient advice that I can. It is a challenge at times to have 
                gone from managing my own projects, jobs, and sometimes a crew 
                in construction to learning to be a part of a team in a large 
                corporation. I have had to learn how to work with different types 
                of employees both good as well as ones who did not care as much 
                as I did.
