        <!--This page will be a introduction and place to get to know me better-->
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Welcome to my chronicling of my 
        Cybersecurity journey, I hope you can see both the path I have taken to get
        where I am, as well as my future aspirations.  From a young age I have been 
        presented with problems that I needed to solve, I can remember wanting to 
        play Nintendo 64 at my cousins house but his mother did not know how to set 
        it up and he was not there.  I knew that if I wanted to play game then I 
        would need to figure out the mysterious yellow, white and red cables and 
        figure out how to plug them into the tv in the white colored plugs that looked 
        the same shape but were not color-coded like on the game system.  This has since 
        evolved into wanting to configure my own Raid storage for my computer with NVMe 
        drives and things like accessing my Apple computer with my Linux system through 
        command line to use Emacs.  Whether I have a need to do something out of my league 
        to solve an issue I am having, like wanting to have my own website server or 
        because I want to upgrade my computer to play the latest game, I am passionate 
        about accomplishing my goals.  <br><br>

	      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of my favorite things about technology 
        is the never-ending evolution and requirement to learn about the latest products and 
        ideas.  There is an abundance of different things to learn in each of the many niches 
        that technology has to offer.  This makes it easy to feed my addiction of research 
        and my drive to learn everything I can.  It has become harder to realize I have to 
        be more selective of the tasks I choose and things I educate myself on simply because 
        of the sheer growth of the world.  This has given me the insight to see which things 
        correlate the most and focus on those.  Seeing how some things fade away as well as 
        how they emerge enhances these insights even farther. <br><br>

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My father owns a construction company and 
        I have worked there from a young age seeing how things are put together and how to 
        tackle large projects.  Working in the mountains comes with many challenges, like 
        having minimal space to work or fit equipment and steep inclines and hard to reach 
        areas.  I have learned to develop problems solving skills and spatial awareness 
        fitting large equipment like a backhoe into a very small area and having to work with 
        large amounts of dirt in very small spaces.  Keeping equipment maintained and seeing 
        how managing materials and time wisely affects the profits of a company has given me 
        respect for how a business can profit. <br><br>

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since my time in Anderson Construction, I 
        have moved away from California to buy a house and raise a family while pursuing the 
        career of my choosing, Cybersecurity.  I got a job at my local Walmart working in the 
        entertainment department while I finish getting my Associate degree in software 
        engineering.  I have since gained experience in customer service and satisfaction, as 
        well as seeing the types of issues people have and learning the best ways to help them.  
        My education has helped me in solving the unique problems they come to me with and 
        giving them the most efficient advice that I can.  It is a challenge at times to have 
        gone from managing my own projects, jobs, and sometimes a crew in construction to 
        learning to be a part of a team in a large corporation.  I have had to learn 
        how to work with different types of employees both good as well as ones who did 
        not care as much as I did.
