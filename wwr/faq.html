            Is this a good trip for kids? &nbsp;What are the age ranges you allow?<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Absolutely this is a good trip for children of all ages. &nbsp; 
            We have found however that children over the age of 8 seem to enjoy it more overall (And parents 
            especially enjoy it more if their children are all over 8). &nbsp;A common concern we get from parents is 
            that their children will be bored stuck on a boat for hours at a time. &nbsp;Surprisingly we deal with very 
            few bored children of any age. &nbsp;The areas we are rafting through are some of the most beautiful in the 
            world, and you never know what you might see around any corner. &nbsp;Not to mention the rapids which keep 
            things very interesting. &nbsp;Each boat also comes equipped with a guide. &nbsp;It has been proven that river 
            guides are unable to go for very long at all without telling stories...some of which are even true!<br><br>
            Is whitewater rafting safe? &nbsp;I don't even know how to swim! &nbsp;Can I still come?<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As with all adventure sports, there is an inherent and assumed 
            element of risk. &nbsp;To help ensure your safety, our guides are all certified in Wilderness First aid and 
            all start with at least 3 years of rafting experience. &nbsp;The most common injuries are sunburns and injuries 
            that occur on land.<br>
            Everyone on commercial rafting trips wears coast guard approved life vest or personal flotation device (PFD). 
            &nbsp;Many non swimmers go on rafting trips and have a great time. &nbsp;Your guide will give you an in depth 
            and engaging safety talk before your trip begins explaining what you should prepare for and do in the event that
             you fall out of the raft.<br><br>
            What is included in the trip?<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will provide all necessary camping equipment. &nbsp;This includes 
            a sleeping bag, foam pad, waterproof duffle bag, small waterproof day bag, tent and a cot, eating utensils and 
            camping chair.&nbsp; We provided water and lemonade during the day. &nbsp;Coffee, tea and hot chocolate are 
            provided during the morning and evening hours. &nbsp;You may bring beer, liquor and soft drinks (in reasonable 
            amounts, 2 cans per day). &nbsp;You may purchase these items either the night before the trip, or on your way 
            to the put-in. &nbsp;3 meals per day, plus snacks<br><br>
            What do I need to bring?<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most effective way to plan for temperature and weather changes in
             the Canyon is to be prepared for both hot & dry and cold & wet. &nbsp;Rain jacket and rain pants- do not bring 
             ponchos. &nbsp;Quick dry shirts and shorts long sleeve cotton shirt and pants- helps keep you cooler on hot days. 
             &nbsp;Button down shirts provide more sun protection on the neck, Light Weight Cotton Pant, Nylon Pant or Sarong.
             &nbsp; The best thing for men to wear are swim trunks as shorts, if you are cold natured, bring polypropylene 
             long underwear top and bottom. &nbsp;Women wear swim suits or quick dry underwear and sport bras as a base layer 
             during the day. &nbsp;Over the base layer, wear a pair of quick dry shorts and the shirt of your choice 
             (polypropylene if you are cold, cotton if you are hot). &nbsp;Two piece swim suits are convenient when changing 
             or going to the bathroom.&nbsp;Bring a hat- large brim hat offers protection from the sun with a good quality 
             strap. &nbsp;Sunglasses with strap, socks- used for hiking and to protect your feet from the sun. &nbsp;sandals 
             or water shoes- if not used to hiking in these, bring a pair of shoes you have hiked in before, camper wear: 
             Bring something comfortable to wear around camp. &nbsp;Cotton dresses, skirts and sarongs are all popular 
             options. &nbsp;Sleep wear: You might choose to sleep in your camp wear. &nbsp;Otherwise, you might like to bring
             something comfortable to sleep in. &nbsp; Bring a water bottle, small day pack for hikes, moisturizing lotion, 
             headlamp or flashlight, moleskin, waterproof sunscreen and lip balm. &nbsp;Optional items: gloves, fleece, jacket,
             towel, bandana, small pillow, hygiene products: toothpaste, toothbrush, tissue, nail clippers, feminine hygiene 
             products, extra eyeglasses or contacts, biodegradable soap and shampoo, camera equipment book, watercolors, 
             journal and pen.<br><br>
            What is so great about whitewater rafting anyway?<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are you kidding me! &nbsp;What's not great about whitewater rafting!...
            &nbsp;Let's describe a common day on the river. &nbsp;Arise in the soft light of the early morning after a night 
            spent sleeping under a beautiful starry sky. &nbsp;Have a hearty warm breakfast of fresh blueberry pancakes or 
            omelets to order, then pack your things and prepare for the day. &nbsp;The day is filled with some combination of
             swift water, rapids, calms, hikes, history, geology, stories, and more good food. &nbsp;We try to hit camp around 
             4 or 5, after setting up your cot you can relax with a good book or good company by the river, or explore around 
             camp 
            while your guides prepare your dinner...something perhaps like steak and potatoes, or grilled salmon...and dutch 
            oven brownies...you won't forget the dutch oven brownies. &nbsp;After dinner it's more relaxing, and you might 
            even be able to talk your guide into another story or two to send you off to bed under more stars than you 
            thought were possible.<br><br>
            How far in advance should I book my trip?<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you have specific dates you need, we recommend booking a year in 
            advance. &nbsp;If you can be more flexible 6 months in advance is usually sufficient.</p>
